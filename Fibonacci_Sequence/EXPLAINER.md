# Fibonacci Sequence: Nature's Code ðŸŒ¿ðŸ”¢

## What is the Fibonacci Sequence?

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It usually starts with 0 and 1.

## The Sequence

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

## How It Works

1. Start with 0 and 1
2. Add the last two numbers to get the next one
3. Repeat step 2 to continue the sequence

## Formula

For the nth Fibonacci number:
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

Where:

- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1

## Fun Facts ðŸŒŸ

- The sequence is named after Italian mathematician Fibonacci
- It appears in nature, like in the spiral of shells
- The ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches the Golden Ratio (â‰ˆ 1.618)

## Applications

- Computer algorithms
- Financial market analysis
- Art and architecture
- Natural phenomena modeling

Remember: The Fibonacci sequence is a simple concept with complex applications!
